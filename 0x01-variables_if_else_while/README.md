0: This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.

1: This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.

2: A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line. You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden). All your code should be in the main function. You can only use putchar twice in your code.

3: A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line. You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden). All your code should be in the main function. You can only use putchar three times in your code.

4: A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line. Print all the letters except q and e. You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden). All your code should be in the main function. You can only use putchar twice in your code.

5: A program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line. All your code should be in the main function.

6: A program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line. You are not allowed to use any variable of type char. You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden). You can only use putchar twice in your code. All your code should be in the main function.

7: A program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line. You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden). All your code should be in the main function. You can only use putchar twice in your code.

8: A program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line. You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden). All your code should be in the main function. You can only use putchar three times in your code.

9: A program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers. Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space. Numbers should be printed in ascending order. You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden). All your code should be in the main function. You can only use putchar four times maximum in your code.
