# File I/O

This Project was done during Full Stack Software Engineering studies at ALX school The aim is to learn about how to handle files (open, close, read and write), file discriptors, system calls and file permission in **C language**

## Technologies
* C files are complied using `gcc 4.8.4`
* C files are written according to C90 standard
* tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

## Files

All of the following files are programs written in C:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-read_textfile.c` | Reads a text file and prints it to the `POSIX` standard output |
| `1-create_file.c` | Create file |
| `2-append_text_to_file.c` | Appends text at the end of a file |
| `3-cp.c` | Copies the content of a file to another file |
