# 0x1A. C - Hash tables

This Project was done during Full Stack Software Engineering studies at ALX school The aim is to learn how to implement Hash Tables with **C language**

## Technologies
* C files are complied using `gcc 4.8.4`
* C files are written according to C90 standard
* tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

## Files

All of the following files are programs written in C:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-hash_table_create.c` | Function that creates a hash table |
| `1-djb2.c` | Function that executes the djb2 algorithm |
| `2-key_index.c` | Function that returns the index of a key |
| `3-hash_table.c` | Function that adds an element to the hash table |
| `4-hash_table_get.c` | Function that retrieves a value associated with a key |
| `5-hash_table_print.c` | Function that prints a hash table |
| `6-hash_table_delete.c` | Function that deletes a hash table |
| `100-sorted_hash_table.c` | C file with some functions that implements a hash table with a sorted linked list |
