# 0x1C. C - Makefiles

This Project was done during Full Stack Software Engineering studies at ALX school The aim is to learn what are makefiles, when, why and how to use them (with variables, explicit and implicit rules) in **C language**

## Technologies
* C files are complied using `gcc 4.8.4`
* C files are written according to C90 standard
* tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

## Files

All of the following files are programs written in C:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-Makefile` | Builds an executable with `all` rule |
| `1-Makefile` | Builds an executable specifying a compiler and source files (`CC` and `SRC` variables) |
| `2-Makefile` | Builds an executable using `CC`, `SRC`, `OBJ` and `NAME` variables |
| `3-Makefile` | Builds an executable using `clean`, `oclean`, `fclean` and `re` rules, and `CC`, `SRC`, `OBJ`, `NAME` and `RM` variables |
| `4-Makefile` | Builds an executable using `clean`, `oclean`, `fclean` and `re` rules, and `CC`, `SRC`, `OBJ`, `NAME`, `RM` and `CFLAGS` variables |
| `5-island_perimeter.py` | Function that returns the perimeter of an island described in `grid` list |
