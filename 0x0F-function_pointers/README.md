# Function pointers

This Project was done during Full Stack Software Engineering studies at ALX school. The aim of this is to learn about function pointers in **C language**.

## Technologies
* Cfiles are complied using `gcc 4.8.4`
* Cfiles are written according to C90 standard
* tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

## Files
All of the following files are programs written in C:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-print_name.c` | Prints a name |
| `1-prray_iterator.c` | Executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array |
| `2-int_index.c` | Searches for an integer |
| `3-calc.h` | Header file that contains all function prototypes and data structures |
| `3-op_functions.c`| File that contains funtions that calculates arithmetics operations |
| `3-get_op_func.c` | Funtion pointer that returns the pointer of the arithmetic functions |
| `3-main.c` | Entry point |
| `100-main_opcodes.c` | Prints the opcodes of its own main function |
